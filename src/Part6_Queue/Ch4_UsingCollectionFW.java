/*ArrayDeque vs LinkedList Implementation:
-In Deque a small number of insertions run in Î˜(n) time by doubling the array capacity and copying elements over.
-Accesse time -dynamic arrays are usually faster than linked lists.
-Memory -  Linked list usually take O(n) total extra memory due to the storage of an extra pointer in each element.
-Worst CAselinked list versions have better worst-case behavior 


Conclusion: If per operation time is not important, Deque implementation is better */
